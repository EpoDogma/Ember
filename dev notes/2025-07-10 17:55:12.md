It took quite a while, but I think I have figured out a path.

Generically, Source Code is put through a Compiler to create Assembly. It is then put through an Assembler to create an Object File, that is then put through a Linker to create the final executable.

Source Code ---> | Compiler | ----> Assembly
Assembly ---> | Assembler | ---> Object File
Object File ---> | Linker | ---> Executable

The current goal for this compiler is to return a basic constant integer. I will first tokenize the input, and directly translate that into Assembly. That will then be Assembled using NASM, and Linked using GNU ld.
