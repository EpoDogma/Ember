# Ember
Ember first attempt at making a compiler. Aptly named because I will be using C++ as my implementation language to create the beginning of my Ember compiler. Currently, my language syntax will follow the foundations of C++.

## Dependencies
For the generic path I have layed out (which is very prone to being changed as I have no idea what I am doing at this moment), the current predicted dependencies are:
- gcc 13.3.0
- nasm 2.16.01
- GNU ld 2.42
